# KREKHED - THE GAME
Introduction:
This document outlines the development plan for Krekhead, a humorous pixel dash game inspired by Geometry Dash and the Chrome dinosaur game, designed for a Python programming project. Developed by Hamza and Danyal, Krekhead promises an addictive blend of skill-based platforming, quirky humor, and pixelated charm.
